# ðŸŒˆ Visible Chat
A quick and simple Spigot plugin to change the color of your chat messages *only on your end*, making it easier to see yourself in chat!

Download the latest version of the plugin [over at the releases page](https://github.com/nkomarn/VisibleChat/releases).

## ðŸ“‹ Configuration
There's one config option, which is the color setting:
```yaml
color: YELLOW
```
You can change this to any of the [supported ChatColor enums in Spigot](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/ChatColor.html).
